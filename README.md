## Description
As a developer looking to practice my skills, I wanted to create a game similar to one I grew up enjoying so that I can learn and understand the process of coding games that people may one day play.

## Installation
No installation is required. All you need to do is download the file from the repository and run 'main.py'.

## Usage
This is a desktop game that users can download and play. The game was created to replicate the bubble shooter games of the past, which were loved by desktop users.
